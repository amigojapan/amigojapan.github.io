<h1>The secret questions hidden between the lines of Genesis.</h1>
<pre>

At the beginning of Genesis we are greeted with thte following phrase 
"In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."
but I think if we "read between the lines" we can almost hear someone
asking "why does the universe exist".
The book of Genesis is full of such things, most of them very mundane.
here are some examples of the answers and the questions i believe where asked:

Genesis 3:16 " Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall
be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
-I believe that when God said he made womankind suffer childbirth, someone was
actually asking the authors "Why is childbirth painful?"

Genesis 3:14–15 So the Lord God said to the serpent: “Because you have done this, you are 
cursed more than all cattle, and more than every beast of the field; on your 
belly you shall go, and you shall eat dust all the days of your life. And I 
will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; 
He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.” 
-I believe someone was asking "Why don't snakes have legs?"

Genesis 3:17-19
And to Adam he said, “Because you have listened to the voice of 
your wife and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, 
‘You shall not eat of it,’ cursed is the ground because of you; 
in pain you shall eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and 
thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants 
of the field. By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, till you 
return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for you are dust, 
and to dust you shall return.”
-I believe someone was asking "why do we need to work for food?"

Genesis 2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, 
and were not ashamed.
Genesis 3:7 "Then the eyes of both [Adam and Eve] were opened
and they realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves
together and made coverings for themselves." 
-I believe someone was asking "why do we wear clothes?"

These are simple questions of everyday life, and they seem to 
have been asked to the authors of Genesis...
We may not be able to tell who the authors of Genesis were, 
but i do believe we can tell why they wrote what they wrote as 
simple answers to questions people around them were asking.
I believe this is the main purpose of the book of Genesis.
