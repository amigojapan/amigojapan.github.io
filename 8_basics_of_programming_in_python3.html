<br>
<br>0.	Sequentiality/Following instructions in order
<br>the first thing we need to learn in order to become a programmer is 
that instructions always follow a regular order, usually from top
 to down (and sometimes from left to right)
for example, if I write:
<pre><code>
BrushMyTeeth()
CombMyHair()
GoToWork()
</code></pre>
it will never got or work before I brush my teeth and comb my hair...
<pre><code>
BrushMyTeeth()
GoToWork()
CombMyHair()
</code></pre>
well, the answer is that I would first brush my teeth, but I would get 
to work unkempt, which would cause trouble, that is why the order of 
the instructions in a program is so important… also because "computers 
are stupid”(recommend
 watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA" target="_blank">this video</a>
 ) which is another thing to keep in mind, with the
  previous script I just wrote, the computer will not intelligently know
 i should comb my hair before going to work.. computers are just
   not capable of such decision making at this level of programming.
If you make a large program, and shuffle its instructions around, the 
program will surely not do what it was originally intended to do.

<br>
<br>1.Variables
<br>a variable is a place in the computer memory where some kind of 
value sometimes a string(some letters),sometimes a number is stored.
 like the value 5 or the string “hello”.   a variable can have a simple 
name like just the letter x or any combination of letters like
  last_name or social_security_number, but not spaces, last name is 
not a valid variable name.
if we have a variable called social_security_number we could assign it 
the value 123458789 as a sample social security number.
variables as their name implied can vary, which seems to be different to
 the mathematical view on variables, in math if you
 say x=5 then x is always equal to 5,  but in programming we can say 
x=3 and then x=5 and the value would first be set to 3 and
  then change to 5.
in the case of a string, the value between the double quotes will be 
assigned to the variable, for example if we had last_name we could
 assign “Einstein” to it easily as follows: last_name= “Einstein”. 
<br>
<br>2.	Statements 
<br>this may be the most difficult part to explain of programming,
almost everything you see in a computer program is a statement, 
statements, but can also appear as
 keywords such as while().
Lets talk about assignment statements.
for example, lets take the following program
<pre><code>
x=3
x=5
x=x+1
</code></pre>
what will be the result of such a program…
well, the first statement, x=3 will set x to 3, then the next statement
 x=5 will (maybe counter-intuitively to some)
 set x to 5, then the final statement  x=x+1 we need to break down into
 its  parts.
we have the x on the left of the equal sign called an “lvalue” which is the same as the 
first x=3, where the x is what stores the value, then we have x+1,
 the value of x at this point of the program is 5 because it comes after
 x=5 so when we do x+1 it is the same as doing 5+1, and then
  finally we assign that to the lvalue, so at the end of the program, x 
will contain 6 which is 5+1.
other kinds of statements we will look at later in this text are things 
like function calls, return statements, conditional statements
 and boolean statements.
<br>
<br>3. Conditionals/block of code 
<br>a conditional statement is a statement which give usually two different 
flow controls depending on wether the statement it is evaluation
is true or false, for example:
In order to explain conditional statements I am also forced to explain what
blocks of code are.
firstly, here is an example in python:
<pre><code>
x=5
if x>3:
  print("x is more than 3")
  print("I wish x was less than 3")
if x<3:
  print("this line wont get printed")
x=2
if x<3:
  print("x is not more than 3")
</code></pre>
<br>
lets go thru that program line by line.
First it assigns 5 to x, then it checks if  x is more than 3, since it is,
it will go into the following "block of code" which starts when we add a tab
or any number of spaces before entering our print statement(print is used in
computers now because computers form the old age used to print their results
on paper instead of a screen), as you can see, the following two lines of
code both are "indented", which means they are a certain ammount to the right.
this means both lines will be executed, and since x>3 is true, the print
statements will be executed and the following text will display on the screen:
<br>
<pre><code>
x is more than 3
I wish x was less than 3
</code></pre>
<br>
then the following line is executed if x<3:, since x is still 5, it means
the statement x<3 is false, which means it won't execute the folloing print
statement, so that line wont be printed to the screen.
finally we set x to 2. and next the if statement checks wether x<3 is true,
which it is, printing out the text in that print statement.
the complete output of this program is:
<br>
<pre><code>
x is more than 3
I with x was less than 3
x is not more than 3 
</code></pre>
<br>
<br>4. Procedures/functions 
<br>now functions need to be broken down into 2 separate parts, the easy
part which is a function call and the hard part which is a function declaration.
in the beginning of this paper I used three function calls to say what I was
telling the computer to do:
<pre><code>
BrushMyTeeth()
CombMyHair()
GoToWork()
</code></pre>
<br>
take the following program
<pre><code>
def calculate_tax(tax_type, amount):
  if tax_type=="luxury":
    return amount * 0.01
  else:
    return amount * 0.08

purse_tax=calculate_tax("non-luxury", 100)
restaurant_tax=calculate_tax("luxury", 100)
print("purse_tax is " + str(purse_tax))
print("restaurant_tax is " + str(restaurant_tax))
</code></pre>
<br>
function calls help us so we don't have to write the same
code many times, for example, in this program we defined the way to
calcualte tax only once, but we did two function calls.
the to calculate_tax function call, saving us from typing the same
thing over and over, we could do 100 function calls to the same 
function and it would not inscrease the size of the program by much..
<br>
<br>Now I will explain how a function is defined.
first the keyword def is used, followed by the function name, function names
follow the same rule as variable names, in this case our function name is
calculate_tax.then an open parenthesis (then the "parameters", which
are the things that change from function call
to function call. they come in the form of variable names, in this case our
parameters are tax_type and ammount.
then comes the function body, which in python is just a block of indented stuff
as you can see this function body has the capability to give an 8 pecent tax
for a non luxury item and a 10 percent tax to a luxury item. 
in our function calls we send the parameters to the function, and they get stored
as variables of the name of the parameters.
finally there is the return statement. which tells the program "send this back
to the function call as the result". (also note that return terminates the flow of
the fucntion, no mroe operations occur ater return, and the flow of the
program goes back to the function call)
in this program, after return is called,  it sets the lvalues of purse_tax and
restaurant_tax.
finally this program prints out the values. values are numbers so they need to
be converted to strings before they can be printed using the print() statement.
this is accomplished by surrounding the values with str().


<br>
<br>5.Input/output
<br>
<br>now, here is the most simple program every programmer starts out with
<pre><code>
print “hello world”
</code></pre>
<br>
this is a simple example of "output"
<br>now lets try some input:
<pre><code>
print("enter your name:")
name=input()
print("enter your last name:")
lname=input()
print("welcome to our program " + name + " " + lname + "!\n")
</code></pre>
the output in my cause after entering my name is as follows:
<br>
<pre><code>
enter your name:
Usmar
enter your last name:
Padow
welcome to our program Usmar Padow!
</code></pre>
<br>
<br>6. Loops 
<br>
while Loops
<br>
<br>
a while loop is a loop that executed while a condition is true, and ends when 
the condition is false.
now lets get some example code:
<pre><code>
cont=True
while cont==True:
    print("continue? 1)Yes 2)No:")
    user_input=input()
    if user_input=="2":
      cont=False
</code></pre>
<br>
here is some sample output for this code:
<br>
<pre><code>
continue? 1)Yes 2)No:
1
continue? 1)Yes 2)No:
1
continue? 1)Yes 2)No:
2
</code></pre>
<br>
<br>
for loops.
for loops are one of the most common kind of loops in programming.
here is some sample code:
<pre><code>
sum = 0
for counter in range(1,10):
    print ("counter is " + str(counter) + " and sum is " + str(sum))
    sum += counter
</code></pre>    
<br>
<br>the output of all of these programs is:
<br>
<pre><code>
counter is 1 and sum is 0
counter is 2 and sum is 1
counter is 3 and sum is 3
counter is 4 and sum is 6
counter is 5 and sum is 10
counter is 6 and sum is 15
counter is 7 and sum is 21
counter is 8 and sum is 28
counter is 9 and sum is 36
</code></pre>
the for loop looks at the range given in range 1,10, it loops around setting
the counter variable form 1 to 9(warning:even tho your range says 10 it will
end at one less than the final number)
<br>
<br>7. lists
a list is a data structure to hold data in order, I think this code will speak for itself(by the way, anything after a # sign is a comment, and won't do anything in the program):
<pre><code>
fruits=["banana","apple","peach","pear"] # create a list
print(fruits[0]) # print first element of list
print(fruits[3]) # print second element
print("now reprinting all fruits")
for fruit in fruits: # loops thru the fruits list and assigns each values to the fruit variable
    print(fruit) # prints current "iteration" of the fruit
print("now reprinting all fruits in reverse")
fruits.reverse() # reverses the list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
print("now printing fruits in alphabetical order")
fruits.sort() # sorts the list in alphabetical order
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
</code></pre>
<br>
the output for this code will look like this:
<br>
<pre><code>
banana
pear
now reprinting all fruits
banana
apple
peach
pear
now reprinting all fruits in reverse
pear
peach
apple
banana
now printing fruits in alphabetical order
apple
banana
peach
pear
</code></pre>

one thing I want to point out is that fruits[0] points to "banana" cause
lists in python are "zero indexed" which means the list starts at 0, not
at 1.

ok, I think if you grasped this you have grasped the very basics of python,
you should now be able to go on to taking the tutorials at the python pages
or other sites. <a href=https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/>here</a> is the link to the python official tutorial.
